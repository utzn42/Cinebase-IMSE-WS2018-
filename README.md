# IMSE-WS2018 MS3
## 1. How to pull the Java project correctly (IntelliJ)
1. Pull the project to fetch the changes which have been made since the MS2 deadline.
2. You will find that the source files now reside within their respective milestone folder.
3. To be able to run the MS3 program, go to `File -> Project Structure -> Modules`, and mark `MS3\src` as a source folder.
4. As in MS2, we need to add the Java driver to the project. Download it at https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/ (mongodb-driver-sync 3.9.1) and unpack the .jar somewhere. Then go to ```File - > Project Structure -> Libraries``` and click +. Select Java and then navigate to the .jar. **Don't** add the file to Git upon being prompted.
4. Good to go!
